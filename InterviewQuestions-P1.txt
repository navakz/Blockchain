7 Interview Questions for any role in Blockchain (with Answers):

1. What is a coinbase transaction?

- First transaction of any block.
- Block rewards to the miner are given through that transaction.
- Coins received in the transaction cannot be spent until 100 block confirmations in the network.

3. What are private keys?

- Every wallet that holds any address has a private key and the public key.
- Public key can be termed as the username (known to everyone).
- Private key can be termed as the password (know only to the user).
- Public key is derived from the private key but it is impossible to go the other way.

4. What is the double spending problem?

- Let’s say you have 100 Rs in your bank Account.
Now you send me 100 Rs online, but before bank confirms the transaction, you send that 100 Rs again to someone else.

- This is the classic double spending! You use the same funds twice.
- This can happen in cryptocurrency with some advanced techniques.

5. What is a 51% attack?

- When miners have more than 50% of the nodes in their control, they can change the state of blockchain.
Eg. the double spending issue described above.
- Miners could halt or even reverse the transactions that have been done.

- This is possible when the malicious miners own more than 50% of hashing network of the blockchain.

- Such an attack is not possible in Bitcoin, because it is so huge now.
But smaller newer blockchains can face this issue.

6. What is a nonce?

- Nonce is “Number used only once”. Miners try to discover this nonce while mining.
- The mining supercomputer generates a random number (nonce), puts it in the current hash in the block header, rehashes that value.
- This value is compared with the hash value provided. If they both match, then the miner is rewarded.
- If that value doesn’t match, the nonce is increased. The process is repeated until the hash value is matched.

7. What are the types of Blockchains?

There are mainly 4 types of Blockchains.

a) Public:
Permission-less, Independent, Transparent blockchains.
Eg. Bitcoin, Ethereum
b) Private:
Opposite of public blockchains. Controlled by a central authority. Eg. Ripple, Quorum.
c) Consortium:
Operated by a group of organisations. More distributed than private blockchains.
Eg. Hyperledger
d) Hybrid:
Mixture of public and private blockchains. It has the security and scalability of private blockchain and public permission-less systems.
Eg. IBM Food Trust
